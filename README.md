*[https://github.com/jdcarrascali/Inferencia-estadistica-2022-I/blob/main/Trabajo_final_1.pdf](First analysis):Monte Carlo simulations allow us to assess the performance of different estimation methods when analytical solutions are not readily available or when there is a scarcity of data. By generating simulated data sets, we can evaluate how well these estimators perform in estimating population parameters.
Specifically, in our exploration, we will focus on the bootstrap, logistic distribution, and maximum likelihood estimator as the solution examples for the given problems. These methods have proven to be effective in various statistical applications, particularly in situations where data is limited.

By conducting Monte Carlo simulations and comparing the performance of these estimators, we can gain valuable insights into their effectiveness and identify the most suitable approach for our specific problem.
